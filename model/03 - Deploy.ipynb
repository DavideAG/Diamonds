    "Create the classifier that can be used by SageMaker to make inferences.\n",
    "1. Use the **AM_Sagemaker_RF.py** as template ###immagino sarà fornito!\n",
    "2. Add arguments to the **parser**:  \n",
    "    a. **'--output-data-dir'**.  \n",
    "    b. **'--model-dir'**.  \n",
    "    c. **'--train'**.  \n",
    "3. They must be of the exact **type** and by default have **environment variables** (the right ones).\n",
    "4. Read the **input files** from the **train path** (a folder) that you will take from the **parser**.\n",
    "5. Split the **train dataset** into **X** and **y** as you did in the previous labs.\n",
    "6. Import **RandomForestClassifier** and build the model as you did in the previous lab.\n",
    "7. Set the **hyperparameters** of the classifier with the **best hyperparameters** found in the previous lab.\n",
    "8. **Fit** the model.\n",
    "9. Save the model by using the **joblib** library (from **sklearn.externals**) in a file **model.joblib** into the **model_dir** directory.\n",

    "Each value of the feature is separated by a **',' (comma)**.  \n",
